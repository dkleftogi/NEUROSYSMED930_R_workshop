# 1.1 load an R package, then explore the R studio environment
#The `ggplot2` package is a very popular package for data visualisation.

#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
help(diamonds)
View(diamonds)

# 1.2 little warm up with arithmetics

#be careful the order of the operators
10^2 + 36
3 + 5 * 2
(3 + 5) * 2
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2  # hard to read
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2)))    # clear, if you remember the rules
2/10000 #Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation: `2 * 10^(-4)`.
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here 


# 1.3 mathematical functions
#we dont have to remember everything, we can always search online or use help pages
sum(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
log(1)  # natural logarithm loge()
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm

# 1.4 comparing things
1 == 1    #equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
1 != 4    #inequality (read as "is not equal to")
1 < 2     #less than
1 <= 1    #less than or equal to
1 > 0     #greater than
1 >= -9   #greater than or equal to

# 1.5 variables
#a fundamendal concept in programming in general
#In computing, a variable is a piece of memory that stores a value that can be changed. 
#A variable can refer to anything from numbers and strings to objects, collections, and pointers. 
#variables are essential in software programsâ€”without them, most modern computing functions would be impossible.

x <- 100
x <- x + 1 
y <- x * 2

#There is something called *type coercion*, and it is the source of many surprises

#be combined into a single vector, it will force them all to be the same type.

# In conclusion: some surprising things can happen when R forces one basic data type into another....

#note on Missing Values

my_matrix[2,3] <- NA

#In real data analysis, it is often the case that we are missing some data in a
#data set. For example, say we want to add tail length to our dataset, but one of
#our cats wouldn't hold still long enough to be measured... we know it has a
#tail (so we can't record it as `0`), but we don't know what it is. We also
#can't record it using a word or code (character; such as `"missing"`) because
#vectors in R all have to be the same type, and weight is numeric. A common
#practice is to use a placeholder value such as `9999`, but that can cause
#problems if we neglect to deal with it properly, so it's not recommended. R has
#a special placeholder for missing values called `NA` - it looks a lot like a
#character value, but it is not - it is a special value that has the same type as
#the vector in which it is found.

# 1.6.5 Factors
#Another important data structure is called a *factor*. Factors usually look like
#character data, but are typically used to represent categorical information that
#have a defined set of values. In modeling functions, it's important to know what the baseline levels are. This
#is assumed to be the first factor, but by default factors are labeled in
#alphabetical order.

mydata <- c("patient","patient","patient" ,"control", "control", "patient")

############## Little exercise e1.6 ############## 

#1. Create a vector `fav_music` with the names of your favourite artists/bands.

#2. Create a vector `num_records` with the number of records you have in your collection of each of those artists.

#3. Create a vector `num_concerts` with the number of times you attended a concert of these artists.

#4. Put everything together in a data frame, assign the name `my_music` to this data frame and change the labels of the information stored in the columns to `artist`, `records` and `concerts`.

#5. Extract the variable `num_records` from the data frame `my_music`. 

#6. Calculate the total number of records in your collection (for the defined set of artists).

#7. Check the structure of the data frame, ask for a `summary`.
